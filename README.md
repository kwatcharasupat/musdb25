# MUSDB25 - A Fully Multitrack Dataset for Music Source Separation

Work in progress. A placeholder repo to allow for processing of the fundraising effort to support the artists whose works have been used in MUSDB.

See [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G2YZvER2SdkC7dzfCfWEpBG2V9R7S0Xg2NLCBcRpaU/edit?usp=sharing) for the list of support links I managed to find. Please feel free to add comments so I can add any I am missing. I general, I will try to match the track that is used in the dataset itself. However, if this is not possible, then I will look for a random track from the same artist with the lowest minimum price.  

To contribute see [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/musdb-artist-support). Please note that they will take 10% processing fee. This is so that I do not ever directly handle the money.
