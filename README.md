# MUSDB25 - A Fully Multitrack Dataset for Music Source Separation

Work in progress. A placeholder repo to allow for processing of the fundraising effort to support the artists whose works have been used in MUSDB.

See [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G2YZvER2SdkC7dzfCfWEpBG2V9R7S0Xg2NLCBcRpaU/edit?usp=sharing) for the list of support links I managed to find. Please feel free to add comments so I can add any I am missing.
